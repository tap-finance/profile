## Motivations
In Web3, there is no doubt that the NFT market is part of the core in Web3. NFT, which started with art and some digital brands, is now being used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, Metaverse, and even real tickets and memberships. This trend will continue to accelerate in the future. 
However, in many collections, there is insufficient liquidity and NFT purchasers are unable to resell at the appropriate time. This has kept large investors and DAOs from inflowing funds and has hindered the development of the market. For the further development of the NFT market, which is the core of Web3, it is essential to solve this liquidity problem. 


## Solution
- What is tapp finance
Tapp finance is Liquidity routing protocol for NFT AMM supporting multiple EVM chains - Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Skale network, and EVMOS. It aggregates information on liquidity pools of NFT AMMs. Users can discover the best pools for providing liquidity for their NFT holdings. 

 
- What‚Äôs good for users
Users will be able to provide liquidity to the optimal pool of NFT holdings. In the current situation, most NFTs are not utilized as assets by holders and it is one of the major reasons why the liquidity of the NFT market does not increase. Once they start using tapp finance, they can effectively utilize their assets, thereby contributing to improving the liquidity of the NFT market.  
  
 
- What‚Äôs good for NFT projects
NFT projects can improve the liquidity of collections. In the current situation, many collections have a low number of transactions, which creates a cycle of even fewer transactions because buyers are concerned that they will not be able to sell at the right time. The provision of sufficient liquidity to the pool of collections by tapp finance can reduce buyer friction and result in a cycle of increased transactions.
